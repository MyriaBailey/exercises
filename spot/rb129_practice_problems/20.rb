# What is the difference between states and behaviors?

=begin
State describes an objectâ€™s attributes, whereas behavior describes
what the object can do. State is often unique per instantiated object
and describes various qualities about the object, whereas behavior
is generally shared between objects of the same class through access
to the same method definitions.
