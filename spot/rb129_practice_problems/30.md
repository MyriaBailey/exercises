How is Method Access Control implemented in Ruby? Provide examples of when we would use public, protected, and private access modifiers.

Method access control is a form of encapsulation that limits what methods and information can be accessed in a class from outside sources. This is implemented using the keywords `public`, `protected`, and `private`, ranging from most to least accessible respectively.

The `public` state is by default, and allows anything with access to the object the ability to invoke its methods. If an object is to be directly used by anything else, it will likely be through the use of its public methods.

The `protected` state allows only other objects of the same class to access the information. This is useful for sensitive information that not everything would be able to access, such as comparing passwords.

The `private` state is for any other method that will not be accessed from the outside. This is commonly used to ensure as many implementation details are hidden as feasible, with only a very limited public interface.
