How does encapsulation relate to the public interface of a class?

Encapsulation refers to the act of bundling state and behaviors, as well as limiting what behaviors or information is accessible in what locations. Because of this, encapsulation is essentially the creation and definition of what public interface a class has, by hiding the implementation details within the class and only permitting some public access via the methods allowed.
